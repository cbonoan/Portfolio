                        <span>Hey!</span> My name is Charles, and I like to make computers do things
                        by speaking their language. My love for coding began my freshman year of 
                        college when I took my first Computer Science course. From there, it was just
                        a snowball effect. I found myself trying to learn something new every week, whether
                        it be a new language, a new framework, or a new way to center a div. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I have especially gained interest in full stack web development. Right now, I am practicing
                        my front-end skills by creating sample web pages. Click <a id="github-link" href="https://github.com/cbonoan/FrontendPractice" style={githubLinkStyle}>here </a> 
                        to see a repo of what I completed over the past few weeks! Currently, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can showcase 
                        my current skillset as well as develop and grow them. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        When I'm not coding, I'm either playing video games, lifting heavy things, or playing
                        with one of my four dogs.
